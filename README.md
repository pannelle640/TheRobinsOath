# The Robins Oath

The Robin's Oath is a writing project I'm working on that is set a psuedo-high fantasy world named Aberoki. Aberoki is dominated by three kingdoms: Almeria, Sutheri, and Tyfell. As of the present period (1040 YAL), Tyfell and Almeria are at war. As crowns fall and stakes rise, a group of royals, outlaws, and soldiers must work their way to the capital and defeat the dark forces opposing them to free their kingdom from the grip of a corrupt and malicious leader.
